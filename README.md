# Home-Field-Advantage
An analysis of the Sporting Phenomena "Home Field Advantage" during the 2021 - 2022 English Premier League Season using SQL and Tableau
## Introduction 
In the English Premier League, teams play 19 games at Home and Away, and collect points based on their performance in a game. A win is worth 3 points, a draw is worth 
1 point, and a loss is worth 0 points. The goal is to collect as many points as possible throughout the Season. Having the most points wins you the league trophy. 
Finishing in the Top 4-7 allows you to compete in Competitions across Europe. However, finish as one of the three lowest point collectors, and you see yourself drop 
down into a lower-level league, where you have to fight to return to the Premier League.



When teams play, one factor that goes under the radar when discussing team performance and getting as many points as possible is "Home-Field Advantage". This is the proposed phenomena that because you are playing on your home field, where your fans are watching you play, you in turn play better and perform at a higher level. So, in the context of the recently finished 2021-2022 season, how prominent was "Home-Field Advantage"?
